## Testing Strategy

### Do We Need Tests for Documentation?
**Answer: Limited testing needed, focus on automation:**

1. **Automated Tests (Recommended):**
   - Link checking (broken internal/external links)
   - Build validation (Docusaurus builds successfully)
   - Deployment verification (site accessible after deploy)

2. **Manual Testing (Essential):**
   - User acceptance testing with real instructors/students
   - Cross-device/browser compatibility
   - Accessibility compliance

3. **No Traditional Unit Tests Needed:**
   - Documentation is content, not code
   - Focus on content accuracy and user experience

### Testing Implementation:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-test.yml
name: Documentation Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd docs && npm install
      - name: Build docs
        run: cd docs && npm run build
      - name: Test links
        run: cd docs && npm run test:links
```

## Success Metrics
