# Requirements Management Rules

## User Story Management Guidelines
- File organization
  - Storage directory: stories/
  - File extension: .story.md
  - Organize sub-directories by business module
  - Naming format: `[module]-[function].story.md`

- Story Document Structure

```markdown
# [story title]

## As a
[Role]

## I want
[Expected functions]

## So that
[Business Value Achieved]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Acceptance Item 1]
- [ ] [Acceptance Item 2]

## Additional information
- Business rules:
  * [Rule 1]
  * [Rule 2]
- Technical requirements:
  * [Requirement 1]
  * [Requirement 2]

## Associated files
- Feature: [path]
- API documentation: [path]
- Prototyping: [path]
```

- Story Development Process
  * Strictly follow the following order:
    1. Create a user story document
    2. Waiting for confirmation of user stories and acceptance criteria
    3. Write a feature file only when the user explicitly requests it
    4. Continue with the next development steps
  * Do not write Feature files before the user story is confirmed
  * Do not start writing feature files without explicit user request
  * Feature file creation needs to wait for explicit instructions from the user

- Requirements and Features
  - Each requirement document corresponds to one or more feature files
  - Record the associated feature file path in the requirements document
  - Annotate the associated requirements document in the feature file header

- Version management
  - Version file naming: `[original file name].v[version number].story.md`
  - Each version file needs to contain:
    * Change Description
    * Reason for change
    * Scope of impact
    * Updated related files

## Best Practices
- Story Writing
  - One story focuses on a complete business value
  - Stories should be small enough to be completed in one iteration
  - Acceptance criteria should be specific and testable
  - Avoid technical implementation details

- Story Review
  - Joint review by business personnel and developers
  - Make sure the story is clear and complete
  - Verify the rationality of acceptance criteria
  - Evaluate technical feasibility
  - You can only proceed to the next step after the story review is passed

- Association Management
  - Update associated files in a timely manner
  - Maintain consistency between documents
  - Regularly check the validity of the association
