## Testing Strategy Guidelines

### Controller Testing Approach
```ruby
# Focus on request specs rather than controller specs
describe "POST /negotiations/submit_offer" do
  it "creates settlement offer with valid params" do
    post negotiations_submit_offer_path(simulation), params: valid_params
    expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    expect(SettlementOffer.count).to eq(1)
  end
end
```

### Service Testing Approach
```ruby
# Mock external dependencies, test business logic
describe CaseScenarioService do
  let(:service) { described_class.new(simulation) }
  
  before do
    allow(ExternalScenarioAPI).to receive(:fetch).and_return(mock_data)
  end
  
  it "generates valid scenario configuration" do
    result = service.generate_scenario
    expect(result).to be_valid
    expect(result.plaintiff_info).to be_present
  end
end
```

### Model Testing Focus
```ruby
# Test validations, associations, and business methods
describe ArbitrationOutcome do
  it "calculates damages correctly" do
    outcome = build(:arbitration_outcome, base_amount: 100_000)
    expect(outcome.total_damages).to eq(expected_amount)
  end
end
```
