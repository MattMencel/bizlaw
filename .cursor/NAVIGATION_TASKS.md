- ✅ **Completed**: Finished and tested
- ❌ **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies

## Priority Levels
- 🔴 **High**: Critical for core functionality
- 🟡 **Medium**: Important for user experience  
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to have optimizations

## Dependencies
- Tasks nav-003, nav-004, nav-005 should be completed before nav-006, nav-007
- Task nav-010 is required before nav-011, nav-012, nav-013
- Tasks nav-019, nav-020 depend on completion of most other tasks

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (core foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (interactions and features)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (responsive and performance)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (testing and integration)

**Total Estimated Time**: 9-13 days ✅ COMPLETED in ~12 days
