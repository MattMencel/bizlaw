## Hidden Client Range
- [ ] As the system, I maintain a hidden acceptable range for each team and use it to generate feedback. _(2 pts)_

## Arbitration Trigger
- [ ] As the system, I trigger arbitration and determine a final settlement if no agreement is reached after N rounds. _(2 pts)_

## Basic Scoring
- [ ] As the system, I calculate and display a score for each team based on timeliness and closeness to the client's ideal. _(2 pts)_

## Dashboard
- [x] As a user, I can view a dashboard showing the case timeline, negotiation history, and feedback. _(3 pts)_ - Completed: Navigation system with left sidebar, courses/teams/cases views, and comprehensive user dashboard
