## 📝 User Story
**As a** [instructor/student/admin], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit].

Example: *As an instructor, I want to bulk-assign students to teams so that I can set up class projects faster.*

## 🥒 Cucumber Scenarios
Write scenarios in Gherkin format that can be directly used in Cucumber tests:

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  As a [user role]
  I want to [goal]
  So that [benefit]

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an [role]
    And I have [prerequisite conditions]

  Scenario: [Happy path scenario name]
    Given [initial context]
    When I [action]
    Then I should [expected outcome]
    And [additional verification]

  Scenario: [Alternative scenario name]
    Given [different context]
    When I [different action]
    Then I should [different outcome]

  Scenario: [Error scenario name]
    Given [error context]
    When I [action that should fail]
    Then I should see [error message]
    And [system state verification]
```

**Example for bulk team assignment:**
```gherkin
Feature: Bulk Team Assignment
  As an instructor
  I want to bulk-assign students to teams
  So that I can set up class projects faster

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an instructor
    And I have a course with 30 students
    And there are 6 teams available

  Scenario: Assign students to teams via CSV upload
    Given I am on the team management page
    When I upload a CSV file with student assignments
    Then all students should be assigned to their designated teams
    And I should see a success message "30 students assigned successfully"

  Scenario: Auto-assign students evenly across teams
    Given I am on the team management page
    When I click "Auto-assign students"
    And I select "Distribute evenly"
    Then students should be distributed equally across all 6 teams
    And each team should have 5 students

  Scenario: Handle assignment errors gracefully
    Given I am on the team management page
    When I upload a CSV with invalid student emails
    Then I should see "3 students could not be assigned"
    And valid assignments should still be processed
```
