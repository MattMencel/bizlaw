Feature: AI-Enhanced Client Feedback System
  As a legal simulation platform
  I want to provide AI-enhanced client feedback for settlement offers
  So that students receive more realistic and contextual guidance

  Background:
    Given I belong to an organization "University of Business Law"
    And I am enrolled in a course "Advanced Business Law"
    And the system has a sexual harassment case "Mitchell v. TechFlow Industries" in this course
    And the case has plaintiff team "Mitchell Legal Team" from this course
    And the case has defendant team "TechFlow Defense Team" from this course
    And both teams have been assigned to the case
    And the simulation has 6 negotiation rounds configured
    And the Google AI service is configured and enabled

  @ai_feedback_generation
  Scenario: Generate AI-enhanced feedback for plaintiff settlement offer
    Given I am a member of the "Mitchell Legal Team" (plaintiff)
    And I am in round 1 of the negotiation
    When I submit a settlement demand of $275000
    And I provide justification: "Significant emotional distress and career impact damages"
    And the AI service generates feedback for my offer
    Then I should receive AI-enhanced client feedback
    And the feedback should include realistic client mood assessment
    And the feedback should provide strategic guidance for next steps
    And the feedback should not reveal opponent information
    And the feedback should be appropriate for the offer amount and round

  @ai_feedback_generation
  Scenario: Generate AI-enhanced feedback for defendant settlement offer
    Given I am a member of the "TechFlow Defense Team" (defendant)
    And the plaintiff team has submitted a demand of $275000
    And I am in round 1 of the negotiation
    When I submit a counteroffer of $125000
    And I provide justification: "Reasonable compensation without admission of liability"
    And the AI service generates feedback for my offer
    Then I should receive AI-enhanced client feedback
    And the feedback should include client satisfaction assessment
    And the feedback should provide risk-based strategic guidance
    And the feedback should reflect defendant perspective appropriately
    And the feedback should consider financial exposure concerns

  @ai_fallback_system
  Scenario: Handle AI service unavailability gracefully
    Given I am a member of the "Mitchell Legal Team" (plaintiff)
    And the Google AI service is temporarily unavailable
    When I submit a settlement demand of $300000
    And the system attempts to generate AI feedback
    Then I should receive fallback client feedback
    And the feedback should still be contextually appropriate
    And the error should be logged for monitoring
    And my user experience should not be disrupted
    And the feedback should maintain educational value

  @ai_event_feedback
  Scenario: Generate AI-enhanced feedback for simulation events
    Given both teams have submitted offers in round 2
    And the simulation is in progress
    When the "media attention" event triggers
    And the AI service generates event feedback
    Then both teams should receive AI-enhanced event responses
    And the plaintiff feedback should reflect increased confidence
    And the defendant feedback should reflect increased concern
    And the feedback should be contextually relevant to the event
    And the feedback should maintain client personality consistency

  @ai_strategic_guidance
  Scenario: Provide AI-enhanced strategic guidance between rounds
    Given both teams have completed round 2
    And there is a significant gap between offers
    When the system generates round transition feedback
    And the AI service enhances the strategic guidance
    Then teams should receive AI-enhanced strategic advice
    And the advice should be role-specific and contextual
    And the advice should consider negotiation history
    And the advice should provide educational value
    And the advice should not reveal opponent strategies

  @ai_settlement_feedback
  Scenario: Generate AI-enhanced settlement satisfaction feedback
    Given both teams have been negotiating for 4 rounds
    When a settlement is reached at $200000
    And the AI service generates settlement feedback
    Then both teams should receive AI-enhanced settlement responses
    And the plaintiff feedback should reflect satisfaction with outcome
    And the defendant feedback should reflect acceptable resolution
    And the feedback should consider final settlement terms
    And the feedback should provide closure appropriate context

  @ai_arbitration_feedback
  Scenario: Generate AI-enhanced arbitration warning feedback
    Given both teams have completed 6 rounds without settlement
    When the arbitration trigger activates
    And the AI service generates arbitration feedback
    Then both teams should receive AI-enhanced arbitration warnings
    And the feedback should express client concern about uncertainty
    And the feedback should reflect realistic arbitration anxiety
    And the feedback should maintain educational messaging
    And the feedback should encourage reflection on negotiation choices

  @ai_mood_consistency
  Scenario: Maintain client personality consistency across AI interactions
    Given I am a member of the "Mitchell Legal Team" (plaintiff)
    And my client has an established personality profile
    When I submit multiple offers across different rounds
    And the AI service generates feedback for each offer
    Then the client mood and personality should remain consistent
    And the communication style should match the established profile
    And the feedback should build on previous interactions
    And the client satisfaction should trend appropriately
    And the strategic guidance should evolve logically

  @ai_caching_system
  Scenario: Utilize response caching for similar contexts
    Given the AI response caching system is enabled
    And a previous similar offer has been cached
    When I submit an offer with similar context parameters
    And the system checks for cached responses
    Then a cached response should be used when appropriate
    And the response should be contextually relevant
    And the cache hit should be logged for monitoring
    And the response time should be improved
    And the educational value should be maintained

  @ai_cost_monitoring
  Scenario: Monitor AI usage costs and limits
    Given the AI service has usage limits configured
    When multiple teams generate AI feedback simultaneously
    And the system tracks API usage and costs
    Then usage should be monitored against daily limits
    And cost tracking should be accurate and logged
    And the system should gracefully handle quota limits
    And fallback responses should activate when needed
    And instructors should be notified of usage patterns

  @ai_configuration_management
  Scenario: Respect AI service configuration settings
    Given I am an instructor managing AI settings
    When I disable AI services for specific simulations
    And students submit offers in those simulations
    Then AI services should not be called
    And fallback responses should be used exclusively
    And no API costs should be incurred
    And student experience should remain consistent
    And configuration changes should take effect immediately

  @ai_response_quality
  Scenario: Validate AI response quality and appropriateness
    Given the AI service is generating client feedback
    When responses are generated for various offer scenarios
    Then responses should be professionally appropriate
    And content should be educationally valuable
    And language should be suitable for academic environment
    And responses should avoid inappropriate content
    And feedback should maintain legal realism
    And responses should encourage learning objectives
