# Sexual Harassment Lawsuit Settlement Simulation - BDD Feature Stories

@sexual_harassment_simulation
Feature: Sexual Harassment Lawsuit Settlement Simulation
  As a legal education platform
  We want to provide realistic negotiation simulation experiences
  So that students can learn settlement dynamics in a controlled environment

  Background:
    Given I belong to an organization "University of Business Law"
    And I am enrolled in a course "Advanced Business Law"
    And the system has a sexual harassment case "Mitchell v. TechFlow Industries" in this course
    And the case has plaintiff team "Mitchell Legal Team" from this course
    And the case has defendant team "TechFlow Defense Team" from this course
    And both teams have been assigned to the case
    And the simulation has 6 negotiation rounds configured
    And the case materials have been uploaded and categorized

@simulation_setup
Feature: Simulation Case Setup and Configuration
  As an instructor
  I want to configure and launch sexual harassment lawsuit simulations
  So that students can participate in realistic legal negotiations

  Scenario: Create new sexual harassment simulation case
    Given I am logged in as an instructor
    And I belong to an organization "University of Business Law"
    And I have a course "Advanced Business Law" in my organization
    When I navigate to create a new case
    And I select the course "Advanced Business Law"
    And I select "Sexual Harassment Lawsuit" as the case type
    And I enter case details:
      | Field | Value |
      | Case Name | Mitchell v. TechFlow Industries |
      | Plaintiff Min Acceptable | 150000 |
      | Plaintiff Ideal | 300000 |
      | Defendant Max Acceptable | 250000 |
      | Defendant Ideal | 75000 |
      | Total Rounds | 6 |
    And I upload the case materials package
    Then the simulation case should be created successfully
    And the case should be associated with the selected course
    And the case status should be "Setup Complete"
    And both teams should see "Case materials available for review"

  Scenario: Assign teams to simulation case
    Given I have created a sexual harassment simulation case
    And I have teams "Plaintiff Team A" and "Defendant Team B" in my course
    When I assign "Plaintiff Team A" as the plaintiff team
    And I assign "Defendant Team B" as the defendant team
    And I set the simulation start date to tomorrow
    Then both teams should receive case assignment notifications
    And teams should have access to their respective case materials
    And the simulation should be scheduled to begin

  Scenario: Configure simulation parameters
    Given I have a sexual harassment simulation case
    When I access the simulation configuration settings
    And I adjust the pressure escalation rate to "moderate"
    And I enable automatic event triggers
    And I set argument quality scoring to "required"
    Then the simulation should use the updated parameters
    And teams should be notified of any rule changes

@negotiation_rounds
Feature: Multi-Round Negotiation Process
  As a student team member
  I want to submit settlement offers and counteroffers
  So that I can negotiate on behalf of my client

  Background:
    Given I belong to an organization "University of Business Law"
    And I am enrolled in a course "Advanced Business Law"
    And I am a member of the "Mitchell Legal Team" (plaintiff) in this course
    And the opposing team is "TechFlow Defense Team" (defendant) in this course
    And we are in round 1 of 6
    And I have reviewed the case materials

  Scenario: Submit initial settlement demand (Plaintiff)
    Given it is round 1 of the negotiation
    When I navigate to the offer submission page
    And I enter a settlement demand of $350000
    And I provide justification: "Compensatory damages for career impact, emotional distress, and punitive damages for company negligence"
    And I add non-monetary terms: "Public apology and policy changes required"
    And I submit the offer
    Then the system should record my team's offer
    And the defendant team should be notified of our demand
    And I should see "Offer submitted - awaiting defendant response"

  Scenario: Respond to settlement demand (Defendant)
    Given the plaintiff team has submitted a demand of $350000
    And I am a member of the defendant team
    When I review the plaintiff's demand and justification
    And I submit a counteroffer of $75000
    And I provide justification: "Dispute liability, minimal damages, offer made without admission of wrongdoing"
    And I add non-monetary terms: "Confidentiality agreement required"
    And I submit the counteroffer
    Then both teams should see the updated negotiation history
    And round 1 should be marked as complete
    And round 2 should become available

  Scenario: Receive system feedback on offers
    Given both teams have submitted offers in round 1
    When the system processes the negotiation round
    Then my team should receive feedback based on our offer
    And the feedback should not reveal the opponent's acceptable range
    And I should see client mood indicators updated
    Examples:
      | Team Type | Offer Amount | Expected Feedback |
      | Plaintiff | 350000 | "Client concerned offer may be too high for quick settlement" |
      | Defendant | 75000 | "Client worried offer may be insulting to plaintiff" |
      | Plaintiff | 275000 | "Client satisfied with reasonable opening position" |
      | Defendant | 125000 | "Client pleased with realistic settlement approach" |

@real_time_events
Feature: Dynamic Simulation Events and Pressure
  As the simulation system
  I want to introduce realistic external pressures and events
  So that negotiations reflect real-world dynamics

  Scenario: Media attention increases settlement pressure
    Given we are in round 3 of the negotiation
    And no settlement has been reached
    When the "media attention" event triggers
    Then both teams should receive notification: "Local news outlet reports on harassment lawsuit"
    And the plaintiff's minimum acceptable amount should increase by $25000
    And the defendant's maximum acceptable amount should increase by $50000
    And teams should see updated client pressure indicators

  Scenario: Additional witness emerges
    Given we are in round 2 of the negotiation
    When the "witness change" event triggers
    Then teams should be notified: "Additional witness comes forward with supporting testimony"
    And the plaintiff team should receive new evidence documents
    And the defendant's acceptable settlement range should increase
    And the case strength indicators should update

  Scenario: IPO timeline pressure for defendant
    Given we are in round 4 of the negotiation
    And the defendant team represents TechFlow Industries
    When the "IPO delay" event triggers
    Then the defendant team should receive notification: "Company announces IPO delay due to pending litigation"
    And the defendant's urgency to settle should increase significantly
    And the defendant's maximum acceptable settlement should increase by $100000

  Scenario: Court scheduling pressure
    Given we are in round 5 of the negotiation
    When the "court deadline" event triggers
    Then both teams should receive notification: "Judge schedules expedited trial date in 30 days"
    And both teams' willingness to settle should increase
    And the arbitration warning should become more prominent

@feedback_and_guidance
Feature: Real-Time Feedback and Strategic Guidance
  As a student team
  I want to receive feedback on my negotiation strategies
  So that I can improve my approach and learn from mistakes

  Scenario: Receive client satisfaction feedback
    Given I have submitted a settlement offer
    When the system evaluates my offer against client parameters
    Then I should receive client mood feedback
    And the feedback should be realistic but not reveal opponent information
    Examples:
      | Client Type | Offer Quality | Mood Feedback |
      | Plaintiff | Too high | "Client getting impatient with unrealistic demands" |
      | Plaintiff | Reasonable | "Client cautiously optimistic about progress" |
      | Defendant | Too low | "Client concerned offer will be seen as insulting" |
      | Defendant | Reasonable | "Client pleased with measured approach" |

  Scenario: Get strategic hints without spoilers
    Given I am struggling with negotiation strategy
    When I request guidance from the system
    Then I should receive helpful hints about:
      | Hint Type | Example Content |
      | Legal strategy | "Consider economic damages calculation methods" |
      | Negotiation tactics | "Think about non-monetary terms that could add value" |
      | Client management | "Remember your client's primary concerns beyond money" |
      | Time pressure | "Early settlement often benefits both parties" |
    But I should not receive information about:
      | Forbidden Information |
      | Opponent's acceptable ranges |
      | Opponent's strategy discussions |
      | Future event triggers |
      | Exact scoring calculations |

    And my research activity should be tracked for scoring

  Scenario: Use damages calculation tools
    Given I need to justify a settlement amount
    When I access the economic damages calculator
    And I input factors like lost wages, emotional distress, punitive damages
    Then I should get reasonable settlement range estimates
    And I should understand the basis for damage calculations

@instructor_monitoring
Feature: Instructor Oversight and Intervention
  As an instructor
  I want to monitor student progress and intervene when necessary
  So that all students have a positive educational experience

  Scenario: Monitor multiple team negotiations simultaneously
    Given I have 4 teams running sexual harassment simulations
    When I access the instructor monitoring dashboard
    Then I should see real-time status for all teams:
      | Team | Current Round | Last Activity | Progress Status |
      | Team A | Round 3 | 2 hours ago | On track |
      | Team B | Round 2 | 5 hours ago | May need guidance |
      | Team C | Round 4 | 1 hour ago | Progressing well |

      | Strategic thinking | 1-5 points | Affects dynamic range adjustment |

@content_security
Feature: Sensitive Content Handling and Safety
  As the educational platform
  I want to handle sensitive sexual harassment content appropriately
  So that students have a safe and professional learning environment

  Scenario: Display content warnings appropriately
    Given a student is accessing sexual harassment case materials
    When they first enter the simulation
    Then they should see a content warning explaining:
      | Warning Element | Content |
      | Subject matter | Sexual harassment lawsuit simulation |
      | Educational purpose | Professional legal education |
      | Professional expectations | Respectful discussion required |
      | Support resources | Counseling/support contacts available |

  Scenario: Monitor team communications for appropriateness
    Given students are communicating within their teams
    When they submit messages or arguments
    Then the system should automatically flag potentially inappropriate content
    And instructors should be notified of any concerns
    And students should receive reminders about professional conduct

  Scenario: Provide alternative assignment options
    Given a student is uncomfortable with sexual harassment content
    When they request an alternative assignment
    Then the instructor should be notified
    And alternative case options should be available
    And the student should not be penalized for the content choice

@arbitration_and_completion
Feature: Arbitration Trigger and Simulation Completion
  As the simulation system
  I want to handle cases that don't reach settlement
  So that all simulations have meaningful educational conclusions

  Scenario: Trigger arbitration after maximum rounds
    Given teams have completed 6 negotiation rounds
    And no settlement has been reached
    When the final round deadline passes
    Then the system should automatically trigger arbitration
    And both teams should be notified: "Case proceeding to arbitration"
    And the arbitration outcome should be calculated and revealed

  Scenario: Calculate arbitration outcome
    Given a case has gone to arbitration
    When the system determines the arbitration award
    Then the outcome should be within a realistic range ($50,000 - $500,000)
    And the outcome should consider:
      | Factor | Influence |
      | Strength of evidence presented | Higher awards for stronger plaintiff case |
      | Legal arguments quality | Better arguments improve outcomes |
      | Negotiation history | Unreasonable positions hurt final outcome |
      | Random variance | Simulate unpredictability of real arbitration |

  Scenario: Complete simulation with comprehensive debrief
    Given a simulation has concluded (settlement or arbitration)
    When students access the final results
    Then they should see:

      | Comparative performance | Rankings and peer comparisons |

  Scenario: Export data for academic records
    Given I need to submit grades for the simulation
    When I export the performance data
    Then I should receive properly formatted academic records
    And individual student privacy should be maintained
    And the data should integrate with existing gradebook systems

  Scenario: Collect feedback for simulation improvement
