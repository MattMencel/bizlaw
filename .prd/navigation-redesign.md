# Navigation Redesign PRD - Implementation Status

## 1. Overview ✅ COMPLETED

### Objective ✅ ACHIEVED
Redesign the Business Law Education Platform navigation to create a hierarchical, role-based sidebar navigation that reflects the legal practice workflow and improves user experience for case-based simulations.

### Previous Pain Points ✅ RESOLVED
- ✅ Flat navigation structure lacks logical grouping → **RESOLVED**: Hierarchical navigation with clear sections
- ✅ No contextual awareness of current case/team → **RESOLVED**: Context switcher with case/team display
- ✅ Missing organizational hierarchy for admin functions → **RESOLVED**: Role-based Administration section
- ✅ Teams not properly associated with their parent cases → **RESOLVED**: Context-aware navigation
- ✅ No visual distinction between different user roles and permissions → **RESOLVED**: Role-based visibility

### Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED
- ✅ Users can quickly identify their current context (case, team, role) → **Context switcher implemented**
- ✅ Reduced navigation time to key simulation features → **Direct access via structured sections**
- ✅ Clear information architecture that scales with additional cases → **Hierarchical structure supports multiple cases**
- ✅ Role-based visibility that shows relevant sections only → **Conditional rendering based on user roles**
- ✅ Improved workflow efficiency for evidence management and negotiations → **Dedicated subsections for workflow steps**

## 2. User Personas & Use Cases

4. **System Administrators**
   - Full system access and configuration
   - User management across organizations
   - System monitoring and maintenance

## 3. Proposed Navigation Structure

### 3.1 Context Switcher (Top Left)
```
📂 [Case Name]
   👥 [Team Name] • [User Role]
   🔄 [Case Phase] • [Round X of Y]
   🟡 [Team Status]
   [Dropdown Arrow]
```

**Context Elements:**
- **Case Name**: Primary identifier (e.g., "Mitchell v. TechFlow Industries")
- **Team Assignment**: User's role within the case (e.g., "Plaintiff Legal Team • Lead Attorney")
- **Case Phase**: Current simulation stage (e.g., "Discovery Phase")
- **Round Progress**: Negotiation round tracking (e.g., "Round 3 of 6")
- **Team Status**: Current action required (e.g., "Offer Pending Review")

**Status Color Coding:**
- 🟢 Green: Ready for action
- 🟡 Yellow: Waiting/Pending
- 🔴 Red: Attention needed
- 🔵 Blue: In progress
- ⚪ Gray: Completed/Inactive
