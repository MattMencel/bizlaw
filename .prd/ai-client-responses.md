# AI-Powered Client Responses PRD

## Overview

Transform the legal education simulation platform's client feedback system from static, template-based responses to dynamic, AI-generated responses that provide more realistic and engaging client interactions for students learning legal negotiation.

## Problem Statement

Current client responses in sexual harassment lawsuit simulations are:
- **Predictable**: Students quickly learn the limited response patterns
- **Generic**: Same responses regardless of case specifics or negotiation history
- **Unrealistic**: Lack the nuanced communication style of real clients
- **Limited Educational Value**: Don't teach students to adapt to varied client personalities

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- Generate contextually relevant, case-specific client responses
- Create distinct client personalities that influence communication style
- Maintain educational value while increasing realism
- Implement at minimal cost (<$10/month for typical usage)

### Success Metrics
- Student engagement scores increase by 20%
- Instructor feedback ratings improve
- API costs remain under budget threshold
- System performance maintained (response times <500ms)

## Target Users

- **Students**: Experience more realistic client interactions
- **Instructors**: Benefit from enhanced simulation realism
- **System**: Maintain performance and cost efficiency

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. AI Service Integration
- **Requirement**: New `ClientPersonalityService` with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite integration
- **Provider**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite (free tier: high rate limits, optimized for speed)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to existing hardcoded responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits with request queueing

#### 2. Dynamic Message Generation
- **Replace**: Static message templates in `ClientFeedbackService`
- **Context-Aware**: Leverage case details, negotiation history, client personality
- **Maintain Structure**: Preserve existing feedback categorization system
- **Integration Points**:
  - `generate_feedback_for_offer!()` - Offer-specific responses
  - `generate_event_feedback!()` - Event-triggered responses  
  - `generate_settlement_feedback!()` - Final settlement reactions

#### 3. Client Personality System
- **Personality Types**: Conservative, Aggressive, Emotional, Analytical, Pragmatic
- **Consistency**: Maintain personality throughout simulation
- **Influence**: Affect message tone, risk tolerance, communication style
- **Storage**: Extend Case model with personality metadata

#### 4. Cost Optimization
- **Response Caching**: Cache similar scenarios to reduce API calls
- **Smart Prompting**: Optimized prompts for cost-effective token usage
- **Budget Controls**: Daily/monthly spending limits with alerts
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs

### Technical Architecture

#### Service Layer
```ruby
# New service for AI integration
app/services/client_personality_service.rb
app/services/ai_response_service.rb

# Enhanced existing services  
app/services/client_feedback_service.rb (enhanced)
app/services/client_range_validation_service.rb (enhanced)
```

#### Data Layer  
```ruby
# Extended models
app/models/case.rb (add personality fields)
app/models/client_feedback.rb (add AI metadata)

# New models
app/models/ai_response_cache.rb
```

#### Configuration
```ruby
# Environment variables
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-lite  # Specify model version
AI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=3000  # 3 seconds (Flash Lite optimized for speed)
AI_ENABLE_CACHING=true   # Leverage response caching for efficiency
```

### API Integration Specifications

#### Request Format
- **Input**: Case context, team history, offer details, personality type
- **Output**: Structured response with message, mood, satisfaction score
- **Timeout**: 5 second maximum per API call
- **Error Handling**: Log failures, use fallback responses

#### Usage Controls
- **Request Tracking**: Monitor API request counts against free tier limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent request queuing for optimal throughput
- **Performance**: Leverage Flash Lite's speed optimization for real-time responses
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for API quota warnings

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up AI service architecture
- Implement Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite integration
- Add basic personality system
- Create response caching

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 3-4)  
- Enhance ClientFeedbackService
- Integrate with offer validation
- Add fallback mechanisms
- Implement cost monitoring

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 5-6)
- Refine personality types and responses
- Optimize prompt engineering for token efficiency
- Add advanced caching strategies
- Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Production (Week 7-8)
- Production deployment
- Monitoring setup
- Instructor training
- Student feedback collection

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Failures**: Implement robust fallback to existing responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle API limits gracefully with intelligent queueing
- **Performance**: Caching and async processing for non-critical responses
- **Quality**: Response validation and manual review workflows

### Business Risks  
- **Educational Value**: Maintain learning objectives in AI-generated content
- **Consistency**: Ensure responses align with case facts and legal principles
- **Bias**: Regular review of AI responses for inappropriate content

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- AI responses generate successfully 95% of time
- Fallback system works reliably
- Stay within Google's free tier limits
- Response quality meets instructor approval

### Should Have  
- Advanced personality customization
- Detailed usage analytics
- Request queueing for rate limit management
- Automated content review

### Nice to Have
- Machine learning from instructor feedback
- Student preference learning
- Advanced emotional modeling
- Integration with external legal databases

## Timeline

**Total Duration**: 8 weeks
**Key Milestones**:
- Week 2: AI service foundation complete
- Week 4: Basic integration working  
- Week 6: Full feature set implemented
- Week 8: Production ready

## Budget

**Development**: No additional cost (internal development)
**API Costs**: $0/month (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite free tier)
**Infrastructure**: Minimal (existing Rails infrastructure)
**Total Monthly Operating Cost**: $0

## Monitoring & Analytics

- API response times and success rates
- Request count tracking against free tier limits
- Response quality ratings from instructors
- Student engagement metrics
- Error rates and fallback usage

## Conclusion

This enhancement will significantly improve the educational value of the legal simulation platform by providing realistic, dynamic client interactions while maintaining cost efficiency and system performance. The phased approach ensures controlled rollout with risk mitigation at each stage.
