- **Team Roles**: Licensor and licensee representatives

### Case Selection Criteria

Consider these factors when choosing cases:

#### **Learning Objectives Alignment**
- Does the case cover your curriculum requirements?
- Are the legal concepts appropriate for your course level?
- Will students gain the intended practical skills?

#### **Class Size and Timeline**
- Can your class size support the required team structure?
- Does the case duration fit your academic schedule?
- Are there sufficient cases for multiple teams?

#### **Student Background**
- Do students have necessary prerequisite knowledge?
- Is the case complexity appropriate for their experience level?
- Will the subject matter be engaging and relevant?

## Step 4: Configure Team Structure

### Team Assignment Options

#### **Automatic Assignment**

- Considers student availability and preferences (if collected)
- Ensures even distribution across plaintiff/defendant roles
- **Recommended for large classes**

#### **Manual Assignment**
- Instructor directly assigns students to teams
- Allows for strategic pairing based on student strengths
- Can accommodate special requests or considerations
- **Recommended for smaller classes or specific pedagogical goals**

#### **Student Self-Selection**
- Students form their own teams within guidelines
- Promotes student agency and collaboration skills
- May result in unbalanced teams
- **Recommended for advanced courses with mature students**

### Team Role Configuration

#### **Plaintiff Teams**
- Represent the party bringing the legal action
- Focus on proving liability and damages
- Develop arguments for maximum settlement

#### **Defendant Teams**
- Represent the party being sued
- Focus on minimizing liability and damages
- Develop defense strategies and counter-arguments

#### **Role Rotation** (Optional)
- Students experience both plaintiff and defendant perspectives
- Requires multiple simulation rounds
- Enhances understanding of legal process

## Step 5: Student Enrollment Process

### Invitation Methods

#### **Email Invitations**
1. Upload student roster (CSV format)
2. Platform generates unique invitation links
3. Students receive email with course access instructions
4. Automatic account creation on first login

#### **Course Code Sharing**
1. Generate shareable course code
2. Students enter code to join course
3. Instructor approval required (optional)
4. Good for self-enrollment scenarios

#### **LMS Integration** (If Available)
1. Connect with your institution's Learning Management System
2. Automatic roster synchronization
3. Single sign-on authentication
4. Grade passback capabilities
